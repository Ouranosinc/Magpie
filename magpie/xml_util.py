"""
Define a default XML parser that avoids XXE injection.

Package :mod:`lxml` is employed directly even though some linters (e.g.: ``bandit``) report to employ ``defusedxml``
instead, because that package's extension with ``lxml`` is marked as deprecated.

.. seealso::
    https://github.com/tiran/defusedxml#defusedxmllxml

To use the module, import is as if importing ``lxml.etree``:

.. code-block:: python

    from weaver.xml_util import XML  # ElementTree
    from weaver import xml_util

    data = xml_util.fromstring("<xml>content</xml>")
