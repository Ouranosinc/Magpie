        Defines how to interpret the incoming request into the targeted :class:`model.Resource` for the given service.

        Each service must implement its own definition.

        The expected return value must be either of the following::

            - List<(target-resource, target?)>  When multiple resources need validation ('target?' as below for each).
            - (target-resource, True)           when the exact resource is found according to request parsing.
            - (parent-resource, False)          when any parent of the resource is found according to request parsing.
            - None                              when invalid request or not found resource.

        The ``parent-resource`` should indicate the *closest* higher-level resource in the hierarchy that would nest
        the otherwise desired ``target-resource``. The idea behind this is that `Magpie` will be able to resolve the
        effective recursive scoped permission even if not all corresponding resources were explicitly defined in the
        database.

        For example, if the request *would* be interpreted with the following hierarchy after service-specific
        resolution::

            ServiceA
                Resource1         <== closest *existing* parent resource
                    [Resource2]   <== target (according to service/request resolution), but not existing in database

        A permission defined as Allow/Recursive on ``Resource1`` should *normally* allow access to ``Resource2``. If
        ``Resource2`` is not present in the database though, it cannot be looked for, and the corresponding ACL cannot
        be generated. Because the (real) protected service using `Magpie` can have a large and dynamic hierarchy, it
        is not convenient to enforce perpetual sync between it and its resource representation in `Magpie`. Using
        ``(parent-resource, False)`` will allow resolution of permission from the closest available parent.

        .. note::
            In case of ``parent-resource`` returned, only `recursive`-scoped permissions will be considered, since the
            missing ``target-resource`` is the only one that should be checked for `match`-scoped permissions. For this
            reason, the service-specific implementation should preferably return the explicit `target` resource whenever
            possible.

        If the returned resource is ``None``, the ACL will effectively be resolved to denied access. This can be used
        to indicate failure to retrieve the expected resource or that corresponding resource does not exist. Otherwise,
        this method implementation should convert any request path, query parameters, etc. into an existing resource.

        If a list of ``(target-resource, target?)`` is returned, all of those resources should individually perform
        :term:`Effective Resolution` and should **ALL** simultaneously be granted access to let the request through.
        This can be used to resolve ambiguous or equivalent parameter combinations from parsing the request, or to
        validate access to parameters that allow multi-resource references using some kind of list value representation.

        `Geoserver`, as if it was unspecified. Attribute :attr:`ServiceGeoserverWPS.resource_scoped` controls the
        behaviour of splitting the defined :attr:`resource_param` into :class:`models.Workspace` and child components.

    .. note::
        The :class:`models.Route` is allowed at the root of the service and for any nested :class:`models.Route`
        resource to support various endpoints such as the ``/web`` user interface, or the REST interface for the
        new generation of `OGC API` services typically on ``/ogc/{features|maps|processes}`` endpoints. No special
