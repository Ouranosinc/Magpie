        Defines how to interpret the incoming request into the targeted :class:`model.Resource` for the given service.

        Each service must implement its own definition.

        The expected return value must be either of the following::

            - (target-resource, True)     when the exact resource is found
            - (parent-resource, False)    when any parent of the resource is found
            - None                        when invalid request or not found resource

        The `parent-resource` indicates the *closest* higher-level resource in the hierarchy that would nest the
        otherwise desired `target-resource`. The idea behind this is that `Magpie` will be able to resolve the effective
        recursive permission even if not all corresponding resources were explicitly defined in the database.

        For example, if the request *would* be interpreted with the following hierarchy after service-specific
        resolution::

            ServiceA
                Resource1         <== closest *existing* parent resource
                    [Resource2]   <== target (according to service/request resolution), but not existing in database

        A permission defined as Allow/Recursive on ``Resource1`` should normally allow access to ``Resource2``. If
        ``Resource2`` is not present in the database though, it cannot be looked for, and the corresponding ACL cannot
        be generated. Because the (real) protected service using `Magpie` can have a large and dynamic hierarchy, it
        is not convenient to enforce perpetual sync between it and its resource representation in `Magpie`. Using the
        ``(parent-resource, False)`` will allow resolution of permission from the closest available parent.

        .. note::
            In case of `parent-resource` returned, only `recursive`-scoped permissions will be considered, since the
            missing `target-resource` is the only one that should be checked for `match`-scoped permissions. For this
            reason, the service-specific implementation should preferably return the explicit `target` resource whenever
            possible.

        If the returned resource is ``None``, the ACL will effectively be resolved to denied access. This can be used
        to indicate failure to retrieve the expected resource or that corresponding resource does not exist. Otherwise,
        this method implementation should convert any request path, query parameters, etc. into an existing resource.
